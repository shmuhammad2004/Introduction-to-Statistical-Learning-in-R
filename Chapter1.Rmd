(c) A flexible approach will produce better fit because the relationship is non-linear. If the relationship is linear , then inflexible methods may fit better.

(d) A Flexible method produce worst result. As a general rule, as we use more flexible methods, the variance will increase and the bias will decrease .


####2.
